Sanjay wants to learn the calculation of integer digits.could you please help him to implements the sum of digits in programming. Notes:- - If the integer is 45,separate the each digits (4+5) the output is 9.

Input Format

input consists of one integer.
Constraints

Given N is greater than 9 and lesser than 99
Output Format

execute the sum of digits values. Notes:-
If the input is above 100, execute the statements is "Invalid Input".
Sample Input 0

23
Sample Output 0

Sum of Digit 23 is 005
Sample Input 1

56
Sample Output 1

Sum of Digit 56 is 011
Sample Input 2

100
Sample Output 2

Invalid Input
